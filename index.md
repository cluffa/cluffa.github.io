# *Portfolio*

This page is a work in progress. All projects are listed, but not all descriptions are finished.

## **Visualization**

### *- Visualization of the Gapminder Dataset Using ggplot/tidyverse Packages in R*

View this project's [final report](https://github.com/cluffa/stat5730project/blob/master/final_report_Alex_Cluff.pdf) and [source code](https://github.com/cluffa/stat5730project/blob/master/final_report_Alex_Cluff.Rmd).

The focus of this project was to explore the famous Gapminder dataset visually using ggplot graphs like the one above. I also used the other tidyverse packages like dplyr to manipulate the data in different ways to create well formatted data that fits into summary tables.

## **Time Series Analysis**

### *- Analysis of Homicides in the US Over Time Using R and an ARMA/SARIMA Model*

View this project's [final report](https://github.com/cluffa/stat5550project/blob/master/final_project_Alex_Cluff.pdf) and [source code](https://github.com/cluffa/stat5550project/blob/master/final_project_Alex_Cluff.Rmd).

This project was based around forecasting methods. I find overall trends, monthly seasonality, and fit ARIMA and SARIMA models. I compare the two model's performance as well as fit. I then forecasted homicides for the next 24 months.

## **Regression Modeling**

### *- Reproducing the Results and Logistic Regression Model of a study on Modeling Prison Sentencing From Facial Features*

View this project's [final report](https://github.com/cluffa/stat3302project/blob/main/group_project.pdf) and [source code](https://github.com/cluffa/stat3302project/blob/main/model.R).  

![model coefficient table](https://github.com/cluffa/stat3302project/blob/main/table2.png?raw=true)  

The idea for this assignment was to gain experience and become more comfortable reading and interpreting scientific research papers. We also learned the importance of reproducibility and transparency. My group was tasked with reproducing the results and models from this paper. I was in charge of the modeling as well as the table for the models, both of which are created with the source code I linked. The picture above is a replication of the table used in the original paper. Interestingly, we ended up finding a mistake in the paper.

## **Machine Learning**

### *- Predicting Ebay Car Prices Using a Random Forest Model in R*

View this project's [final report](https://github.com/cluffa/stat4620project/blob/master/final_report_made_in_colaboration_with_classmates.pdf), [source code for the random forest model](https://github.com/cluffa/stat4620project/blob/master/randomForest.R), and [source code for cleaning the data](https://github.com/cluffa/stat4620project/blob/master/clean_autos_dataset.R).  

This was a group project. I handled the random forest model as well as the data cleaning.

### *- Fitting a Bayesian Hierarchical Model on Fake Flu Data. Simulated with an MCMC algorithm using R and Rjags/jags.*

View this project's [final report](https://github.com/cluffa/stat3303project/blob/master/Final_project_Alex_Cluff.pdf), [report source code](https://github.com/cluffa/stat3303project/blob/master/Final_project_Alex_Cluff.Rmd), and [model fitting source code](https://github.com/cluffa/stat3303project/blob/master/fit.R)

### *- Classification of Tweets as Being the Result of a Disaster Using R*  

View this project's [R Notebook](https://github.com/cluffa/nlp_intro_R/blob/master/README.md).  

### *- K-means Image Clustering in R*  

View this project's [R Notebook](https://github.com/cluffa/kmeans_image_clustering_R/blob/master/README.md).

### *- Predicting Survivors of the Titanic in Python Using Scikit-learn.*  

View this project's [Jupyter Notebook](https://github.com/cluffa/titanic/blob/master/titanicV2.ipynb).  

Feature engineering like multivariate imputing and matching families got me to a kaggle accuracy score of 0.801 and position 623 out of 13,000 where the top 160 are falsified entries. I used sklearn libraries for modeling as well as cleaning. The model used is a gradient boosting classifier.

### *- Recognizing Digit with a Convolutional Neural Network using TensorFlow, Keras, and Python*
